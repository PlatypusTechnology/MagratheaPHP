# Magrathea Fix for v.1.3.0

### change:
The way relational information is stored was modified. Now one object can have more than one same relation with the same other object.
Example:
we have an object `task` and an object `user`.
If two different columns are linking a task to a user, in previous versions of Magrathea, this relation would be always overwrited when you created a new relation using the same two objects. This was happening because the way the relations were being stored in `magrathea_objects.conf`:

```
[relations]
	rel_name[] = "rel_User_has_many_Tasks"
	rel_obj_base[] = "User"
	rel_type[] = "has_many"
	rel_type_text[] = "has many"
	rel_object[] = "Task"
	rel_field[] = "user_created"
	rel_property[] = "User"
	rel_method[] = "GetUser"
```

now, the new version would create something like this

```
[relations]
	rel_name[] = "rel_user_created_has_many_Tasks"
	rel_obj_base[] = "User"
	rel_type[] = "has_many"
	rel_type_text[] = "has many"
	rel_object[] = "Task"
	rel_field[] = "user_created"
	rel_property[] = "CreateUser"
	rel_method[] = "GetCreateUser"
```

the change was setting the column to the relation name instead of setting the object.
so now, for creating more relations would be easy:

```
[relations]
	rel_name[] = "rel_user_created_has_many_Tasks"
	rel_name[] = "rel_user_assigned_has_many_Tasks"
	rel_obj_base[] = "User"
	rel_obj_base[] = "User"
	rel_type[] = "has_many"
	rel_type[] = "has_many"
	rel_type_text[] = "has many"
	rel_type_text[] = "has many"
	rel_object[] = "Task"
	rel_object[] = "Task"
	rel_field[] = "user_created"
	rel_field[] = "user_assigned"
	rel_property[] = "CreateUser"
	rel_property[] = "AssignedUser"
	rel_method[] = "GetCreateUser"
	rel_method[] = "GetAssignedUser"
```



for relations created before than that, however, you may lose the connection. This would happen if the name used to the property is a different name than the name of the object.
To fix this, just manually replace the name of the object for the column of the property on the relation name.

Sorry about this mess.
