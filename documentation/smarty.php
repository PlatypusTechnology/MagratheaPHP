		<h1>Smarty</h1>

		The template engine used in Views for Magrathea is Smarty.<br/>
		Smarty was choosen because it is clean, fast, quick to learn and easy to maintain.<br/>
		<br/>

		The engine website is <a href="http://www.smarty.net/" target="_blank">http://www.smarty.net/ <i class="icon-external-link"></i></a> and its documentation is also available <a href="http://www.smarty.net/documentation" target="_blank">there <i class="icon-external-link"></i></a>.

		<b>Could I just include Smarty in Magrathea's code and get you rid of all this work?</b><br/>
		Yes. I could. But, if you already use Smarty, then you don't get repeated code in your project. And Smarty guys must get their credit. And I'm giving you the oportunity of building a beautiful structure to your project!<br/>
		You're welcome, man... you're welcome! ;)
